# Synthetic_Data_Creation
This is a project where I explore the creation of synthetic data. There are multiple reasons for me to persue this project. First, finding good data sets can be difficult for an aspiring machine learning engineer once you're trained on the handful of training dataset. Second, although data cleaning and feature engineering are part of the process of becoming a good ML model developer, knowing before hand what the "shape" and difficulties that are presented by the by a data set can allow you to see how different models are effected by different types of data sets. Finally, this is a lot of learning opprotunity is just figuring out how to build data sets that can offer insights into existing data sets.
